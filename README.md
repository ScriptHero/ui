Core UI Component Library


## Proposed Goals

### 1. Match the UX Team's Component Library

The component library should translate 1:1 as much as possible to the component library the ScriptHero UX team maintains, colors, names, spacing, borders, etc.

### 2. Provide a base where extensions can be made

Lower level building blocks can provide flexibility to build additional feature-specific components

### 3. Excellent Developer Experience

We should strive to optimize this library for developer happyness with first-class tooling, easy-to-understand component interfaces, and well-documented. 


## How to use

1. Configure project npm/yarn to have access to github's private npm registry (@TODO)

2. Add to your project's `package.json`
```
"@scripthero/ui": "^1.0.0"
```



## Development / Contributing
@TODO, but in the meantime, check out the Projects tab in github and make PRs!
